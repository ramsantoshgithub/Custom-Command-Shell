# MyShell: A Custom Command Shell in C

This project is a custom command-line shell implemented in C for a Linux-based environment. It is designed to replicate core functionalities of a standard shell, such as executing commands, handling multiple processes, and managing I/O redirection, using fundamental OS system calls like `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`.

## ✨ Features

  * **Interactive Prompt**: Displays an interactive prompt showing the current working directory followed by a `$` symbol               
  * **Command Execution**: Executes basic Linux commands with their arguments by creating new processes. 
  * **Directory Navigation**: Includes built-in support for the `cd` command to change the current working directory.  This supports absolute/relative paths and the `..` notation for the parent directory.
  * **Sequential Execution**: Run multiple commands in sequence, one after the other, using the `##` separator.  The shell waits for each command to complete before starting the next one. 
  * **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple commands concurrently using the `&&` separator.The shell will launch all parallel commands and wait for all of them to terminate before accepting a new command. 
  * **Output Redirection**: Redirect the standard output (STDOUT) of a command to a file using the `>` operator. 
  * **Signal Handling**: Gracefully handles `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+Z` signals. The shell itself will not terminate, allowing the running command to process the signal. 
  * **Error Handling**: If a command is entered in an incorrect format that the shell cannot process, it will display the message: `Shell: Incorrect command`. Any errors generated by the executed commands themselves will also be displaye
  * **Command Pipelines (Bonus Feature)**: Supports command pipelines using the `|` operator, allowing the standard output of one command to be chained as the standard input to the next.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
  * A Linux-based operating system

### Compilation

To compile the shell, navigate to the source directory and run the following command:

```bash
gcc myshell.c -o myshell
```

### Execution

To start the shell, run the compiled executable:

```bash
./myshell
```

The shell is now ready to accept commands. To terminate the shell, simply type the `exit` command and
